## Selected Project in Data Science and Machine Learning Project

### Prediction of User Visits Through the Promotional Banner Feature
The e-commerce division wants to predict whether users who are visiting the new website page will click on the promo banner (ads) on the website or not based on existing features. I created a machine learning model to solve the problem of e-commerce.

### Machine Learning Project: Recommender System with Similarity Function]

In this project I created a recommender system that uses the Content/feature of the film, then calculated the similarity of one and the other so that when we point to one film, we will get several other films that have similarities with the film. This is commonly referred to as a Content Based Recommender System.

### Dentist Patient Visit Predictions

In this project I created a linear regression model to predict the number of patients who came to visit the dentist based on sales data of several types of sweet foods

### Analyzing the Growth and Trends of Data Science Roles: A Comparative Study of Job Titles, Salaries, Country Classification, and Company Size

I investigate the evolving field of data science. Through a comprehensive examination, I explore the relationship between job titles and salaries, the impact of country classification on compensation, and the correlation between company size and average salary. By uncovering patterns and trends in these areas, I aim to provide valuable insights for professionals and organizations, facilitating informed decision-making regarding career paths, talent acquisition, and compensation strategies.
