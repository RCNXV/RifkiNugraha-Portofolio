## Selected Project in Data Science and Machine Learning Project

### Prediction of User Visits Through the Promotional Banner Feature

In this project, I have developed a machine learning model to tackle the challenge faced by the e-commerce division, which aims to predict whether users visiting the new website page will click on the promotional banner (ads) displayed on the site. By leveraging existing features and data, the model is designed to analyze user behavior and patterns to determine the likelihood of engagement with the promotional banners. This predictive capability can provide valuable insights for the e-commerce division, enabling them to optimize their marketing strategies and tailor their ad placements to effectively target potential customers. The machine learning model offers a data-driven solution to enhance user engagement and increase the effectiveness of promotional efforts on the e-commerce platform.

### Machine Learning Project: Recommender System with Similarity Function

In this project, I have developed a content-based recommender system that utilizes the features of films to calculate their similarity and generate recommendations. By analyzing the content and characteristics of each film, the system can identify similarities and patterns among them. When a user selects a particular film, the recommender system leverages this information to provide a curated list of other films that share similar content and features. This content-based approach allows for personalized recommendations based on specific film preferences and helps users discover new movies that align with their interests and tastes.

### Dentist Patient Visit Predictions

In this project, I have developed a linear regression model to predict the number of patients visiting a dentist based on sales data of various types of sweet foods. By analyzing the sales figures of these sweet foods, which are often associated with dental issues, the model aims to identify correlations between the consumption of such foods and the number of dental visits. By understanding these relationships, dental practices can gain insights into potential fluctuations in patient numbers and better plan their resources accordingly. This predictive model offers a data-driven approach to optimize scheduling, resource allocation, and dental care management, ultimately improving the efficiency and effectiveness of dental practices.

### Analyzing the Growth and Trends of Data Science Roles: A Comparative Study of Job Titles, Salaries, Country Classification, and Company Size

I investigate the evolving field of data science. Through a comprehensive examination, I explore the relationship between job titles and salaries, the impact of country classification on compensation, and the correlation between company size and average salary. By uncovering patterns and trends in these areas, I aim to provide valuable insights for professionals and organizations, facilitating informed decision-making regarding career paths, talent acquisition, and compensation strategies.
